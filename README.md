Project Description:

The project is important because it tackles a challenging problem that is present in society. 
Oftentimes, drivers are not aware of the fact that they are distracted, drowsy, or unattentive while driving. 
We are excited about the project because we hope to utilize the skills we have learned in the course to develop a meaningful system that will contribute to the improvement of
driver safety. Some existing issues in current data management practices include inconsistencies in datasets, biases or unrepresentative datasets of a training model’s population, 
and scattered data that is across various systems and applications. 

There are prior related works on the topic of driver drowsiness. 
A few instances of prior works revolve around drowsiness detection using respiration in thermal imaging, fatigue detection based on yawning in thermal images, driver drowsiness detection using face, eye features, and a convolutional neural network. 
Such prior work is relevant to our project because it showcases how various researchers and data scientists have used various features to create prediction models.
